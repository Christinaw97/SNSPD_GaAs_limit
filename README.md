# SNSPD_GaAs_limit

To plot tthe digitized electron recoil and limit plots, use `plotting_scripts/plot_digitized_electron_recoil.ipynb' and `plotting_scripts/plot_digitized_limit_plots.ipynb'

To calculate electron recoil rate/histogram using `GaAs_QEDark` code, then use `electron_recoil.ipynb`
To calculate the limits with the signal rate from `GaAs_QEDark` code, use `limit_plots.ipynb`.

### GaAs_QEDark

`GaAs_QEDark` is code received from Aman Singal and Rouven Essig.
